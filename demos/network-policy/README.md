This example was taken from https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gke-network-policy-demo and modified slightly to fit our needs including:
* Changing the namespaces involved to fit our needs around team1 and team2

Like that project this example came from, this workshop is also licenced under the Apache-2.0 open-source licence.
